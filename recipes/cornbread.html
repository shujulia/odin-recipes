    <h2>Perfect Thanksgiving Cornbread</h2>
    <p>I made these for a thanksgiving potluck and even though I had slightly overbaked it, it was still moist. I gave out the recipe for this afterwards, and converted some cornbread haters!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter melted</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup buttermilk, shake before measuring</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 &#8457; and place cast iron skillet into the oven with the butter.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the centre and add buttermilk and eggs. Mix, then add slightly cooled butter until just combined.</li>
        <li>Remove pan from oven and pour batter into the hot skillet.</li>
        <li>Bake until cornbread begins to brown and a toothpick comes out clean (20-23 min). Allow to cool for 10 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
