    <h2>Earl Grey Shortbread Cookies</h2>
    <p>I brought these cookies to a lab Christmas party and they were a hit! A graduate student asked me for the recipe afterwards. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 teabags of earl grey tea</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 &#8457;.</li>
        <li>Whisk together the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the butter and sugar until doubled in volume. Set beater to low and add the egg, then the vanilla extract. Do not overmix. Gradually add dry ingredients and beat until just combined, being sure to scrap the sides. </li>
        <li>Scoop cookies into 3 tbsp sized balls. Place them 3 inches apart of the pans, and sprinkle with sugar for garnish.</li>
        <li>Bake cookies for 12 minutes until the edges have set but the centers are still soft. They will continue to bake. Cool for 20 minutes on a wire rack until set.</li>
    </ol>
